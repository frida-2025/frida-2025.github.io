# The 12th Workshop on Formal Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms

**Date:** Monday, October 27, 2025 (whole-day workshop)

**Location:** Berlin, Germany

**Colocated with:** [DISC 2025](https://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2025/)

## About FRIDA

The FRIDA workshop aims to foster collaboration between the distributed algorithms and formal verification communities. This workshop provides a forum for researchers to present recent advances in formal reasoning about distributed algorithms and systems, share experiences, and discuss future directions.

## Topics of Interest

The topics of interest for the FRIDA workshop include the following, as they apply to distributed algorithms and systems:

* formal modeling
* model checking
* interactive theorem proving
* parameterized model checking
* integration of different verification techniques
* benchmarking
* synthesis
* run-time verification
* testing
* invariant inference

## Call for Participation

We are looking for speakers to present their work at FRIDA 2025. Please submit proposals for talks by email to the organizers by **September 30, 2025**. Submissions will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Talk proposals should include:
- Title and abstract
- Brief speaker bio
- Estimated duration (typically 30-40 minutes including discussion)

Please send your proposals to both organizers:

## Previous Editions

Starting a productive dialogue between distributed algorithms and verification communities was the goal of a successful [Dagstuhl Seminar "Formal Verification of Distributed Algorithms"](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13141) which was held in April 2013. During this seminar, the participants agreed that a series of workshops should be held in order to strengthen the community that does research on these issues.

The FRIDA workshop has taken place every year since 2014:
